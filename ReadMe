The project is a guided learning frontend engine on google.com

It shows several tips, each tip highlights the element it explains and shows the tip in the container.

Move between the tips by using the next and back buttons.

Back button will appear after the first tip.

On the last tip, next button will turn into a done button and close the program.

Program can also close by pressing the X button.

Remind me later button will show the tip again in 5 seconds. (Irl this would be a longer time, but for the sake of testing it's set to 5 seconds.)

Container will also appear in position relevant to the element and fade in after relevant time.
